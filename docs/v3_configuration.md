## Rails Configuration with Symmetric Encryption v3:

If deploying to Heroku, see: [Heroku Configuration](heroku.html)

For a standalone environment without Rails, see: [Standalone Configuration](standalone.html)

### Add to Gemfile

Add the following line to your Gemfile _after_ the rails gems:

~~~ruby
gem 'symmetric-encryption'
~~~

Install using bundler:

    bundle

### Creating the configuration file

Generate the configuration file and encryption keys for every environment:

    rails generate symmetric_encryption:config OUTPUT_PATH

#### Save to version control

This configuration file should be checked into the source code control system.
It does Not include the Symmetric Encryption keys. They will be generated in the
next step.

### Generating and securing the Symmetric Encryption keys

Once development and testing is complete we need to generate secure encryption
key files for production. It is recommended that the step below be run on only
one of the production servers. The generated key files must then be copied to
all the production web servers.

#### Notes

* Do not run this step more than once, otherwise new keys will be generated
  and any encrypted data will no longer be accessible.

* Do not run this step on more than one server in each environment otherwise
  each server will be encrypting with it's own key and the servers will not be able
  to decrypt data encrypted on another server. Just copy the generated files to each
  server

The symmetric encryption key consists of the key itself and an optional
initialization vector.

To generate the keys run the following command once only in each environment:

Symmetric Encryption v4.0 and above: 

    symmetric-encryption --generate 
    
Symmetric Encryption v3.0: 

    rails generate symmetric_encryption:new_keys production
    

Replace `production` above as necessary for each environment.

Make sure that the current user has read and write access to the folder listed
in the config file option key_filename.

Note: Ignore the warning about the key files "not found or readable" since they
are being generated

Once the Symmetric Encryption keys have been generated, secure them further by
making the files read-only to the Rails user and not readable by any other user.
Change ownership of the keys to the rails user and only give it access to read the key files:

    chown rails /etc/rails/keys/*
    chmod 0400 /etc/rails/keys/*

Change `rails` above to the userid under which your Rails processes are run
and update the path to the one supplied when generating the config file or
look in the config file itself

When running multiple Rails servers in a particular environment copy the same
key files to every server in that environment. I.e. All Rails servers in each
environment must run the same encryption keys.

Note: The generate step above must only be run once in each environment

## Supporting Multiple Encryption Keys

According to the PCI Compliance documentation: "Cryptographic keys must be changed on an annual basis."

During the transition period of moving from one encryption key to another
symmetric-encryption supports multiple Symmetric Encryption keys. If decryption
with the current key fails, any previous keys will also be tried automatically.

By default the latest key is used for encrypting data. Another key can be specified
for encryption so that old data can be looked in queries, etc.

Since just the Symmetric Encryption keys are being changed, we can still continue to
use the same RSA Private key for gaining access to the Symmetric Encryption Keys

### Configuring multiple Symmetric Encryption keys

Create a configuration file in config/symmetric-encryption.yml per the following example:

~~~yaml
#
# Symmetric Encryption for Ruby
#
---
# For the development and test environments the test symmetric encryption keys
# can be placed directly in the source code.
# And therefore no RSA private key is required
development: &development_defaults
  key:    1234567890ABCDEF
  iv:     1234567890ABCDEF
  cipher_name: aes-128-cbc

test:
  <<: *development_defaults

production:
  # Since the key to encrypt and decrypt with must NOT be stored along with the
  # source code, we only hold a RSA key that is used to unlock the file
  # containing the actual symmetric encryption key
  #
  # Sample RSA Key, DO NOT use this RSA key, generate a new one using
  #    openssl genrsa 2048
