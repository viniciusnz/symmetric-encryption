module SymmetricEncryption
  # Read from encrypted files and other IO streams
  #
  # Features:
  # * Decryption on the fly whilst reading files
  # * Large file support by only buffering small amounts of data in memory
  class Reader
    # Open a file for reading, or use the supplied IO Stream
    #
    # Parameters:
    #   file_name_or_stream:
    #     The file_name to open if a string, otherwise the stream to use
    #     The file or stream will be closed on completion, use .initialize to
    #     avoid having the stream closed automatically
    #
    #   buffer_size:
    #     Amount of data to read at a time.
    #     Minimum Value 128
    #     Default: 16384
    #
    # Note: Decryption occurs before decompression
    #
    # # Example: Read and decrypt a line at a time from a file
    # SymmetricEncryption::Reader.open('test_file') do |file|
    #   file.each_line {|line| p line }
    # end
    #
    # # Example: Read and decrypt entire file in memory
    # # Not recommended for large files
    # SymmetricEncryption::Reader.open('test_file') {|f| f.read }
    #
    # # Example: Reading a limited number of bytes at a time from the file
    # SymmetricEncryption::Reader.open('test_file') do |file|
    #   file.read(1)
    #   file.read(5)
    #   file.read
    # end
    #
    # # Example: Read and decrypt 5 bytes at a time until the end of file is reached
    # SymmetricEncryption::Reader.open('test_file') do |file|
    #   while !file.eof? do
    #     file.read(5)
    #   end
    # end
    #
    # # Example: Read, Unencrypt and decompress data in a file
    # SymmetricEncryption::Reader.open('encrypted_compressed.zip', compress: true) do |file|
    #   file.each_line {|line| p line }
    # end
    #
    # # Example: Reading from a CSV file
    #
    # require 'csv'
    # begin
    #   csv = CSV.new(SymmetricEncryption::Reader.open('csv_encrypted'))
    #   csv.each {|row| p row}
